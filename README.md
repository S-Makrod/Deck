## Description 
This is my Deck GUI developed using Java OOP and Java Swing. It allows the user to interact with a deck of cards as you would in real life.

Features Implemented
<ol>
 <li>Shuffle: This randomizes the deck of cards</li>
 <li>Sort Rank: This sorts the cards by rank by using quicksort</li>
 <li>Sort Suit: This sorts the cards by suit using selection sort</li>
 <li>Deal: This will deal card number x where x is choosen through the combo box next to the deal option</li>
 <li>Add: This will add a card to the end of the deck, the card is specified by the two combo boxes to the right</li>
 <li>Search: This will hide all cards that do not match the card you are looking for and output the positions of the cards on the screen</li>
</ol>
